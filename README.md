# LongBlade

The long blade is a work in progress keyboard inspired by the vaporblade and hyperblade from https://www.qlavier.com

# Layout

The layout is currently planned to be the same as a normal 100% ansi keyboard but with the esc/f row of keys being moved to a macro cluster to the far left of the keyboard.

Here is an early preview:

# Firmware

The firmware used is going to be the [QMK keyboard firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) however that is currently far away.
