# LongBlade

The long blade is a work in progress keyboard inspired by the vaporblade and hyperblade from https://www.qlavier.com

# Layout

The layout is currently planned to be the same as a normal 100% ansi keyboard but with the esc/f row of keys being moved to a macro cluster to the far left of the keyboard
